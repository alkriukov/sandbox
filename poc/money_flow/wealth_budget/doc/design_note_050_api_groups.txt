Users can create own user groups, add others (depending on groups and other users settings)
By detault, all users have own name='Contacts'
Regular users can have only simple group type. App administrators can create other group types e.g. Domain

    GROUP.POST(session_token, name)
        if valid SESSION_TOKEN:
            identify user_id
            add new GROUP with name owner=user_id and creates default settings

    GROUP.GET(session_token, id=)
        if valid SESSION_TOKEN:
            identify user_id
            if group id specified
                if user owns or belongs to the group:
                    return group name type owner
            else:
                get groups owned by user
                get groups where user is a member
                return their ids and names

    GROUP.PUT(session_token, id, new_name, new_owner)
        if valid SESSION_TOKEN:
            identify user_id
            if user owns this group OR group_settings allow members control:
                assign new name and/or owner to the group
            
    GROUP.DELETE(session_token, id)
        if valid SESSION_TOKEN:
            identify user_id
            if user owns this group OR group_settings allow members control:
                delete the group

    GROUP_MEMBER.POST / DELETE (session_token, group_id, user_id)
        if valid SESSION_TOKEN:
            identify acting user_id
            if acting user owns this group OR group_settings allow members control:
                if user_id is not in the group yet and allows to be added / if user is in the group:
                    add user_id to group_id / delete user_id from group

    GROUP_MEMBER.GET(session_token, group_id)
        if valid SESSION_TOKEN:
            identify acting user_id
            if acting user owns this group OR group_settings allow members control:
                return all user_ids

* We're not digging into group settings yet. So far group is just a group, and settings are just settings
